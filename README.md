 [ðŸ’¡CUDA cheatsheet](./cuda_cheatsheet.md)
 
 ## Course
 1. [Accelerating Applications with CUDA C/C++](AC_CUDA_C.ipynb)
 2. [Unified Memory](Unified%20Memory.ipynb)

## Objectives
	By the time you complete this lab, you will be able to:

	* Write, compile, and run C/C++ programs that both call CPU functions and launch GPU kernels.
	* Control parallel thread hierarchy using execution configuration.
	* Refactor serial loops to execute their iterations in parallel on a GPU.
	* Allocate and free memory available to both CPUs and GPUs.
	* Handle errors generated by CUDA code.
	* Accelerate CPU-only applications.
